			Forests at different latitudes and elevations form distinctly different ecozones: boreal forests near the poles, tropical forests near the equator and temperate forests at mid-latitude. Higher elevation areas tend to support forests similar to those at higher latitudes, and amount of precipitation also affects forest composition.

&lt;p&gt;A forest is a large area dominated by trees.
 Hundreds of more precise definitions of forest are used throughout the 
world, incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height, land 
use, legal standing and ecological function.
 According to the widely used United Nations Food and Agriculture 
Organization definition, forests covered four billion hectares (15 
million square miles) or approximately 30 percent of the world's land 
area in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
